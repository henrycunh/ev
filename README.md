## Getting started

### Initializing

Install [**Node >= 14**](https://nodejs.org/en/) and run:
```
npx ev
```
It will prompt you for a new **secret key** and create two new files:
  - `.ev/vars` - where your environment variables are encrypted and safely stored,
  - `.ev/secret` - your secret key, whose must not be version controlled

And add `.ev/secret` to `.gitignore`

You can install `ev` globally <sup>*(so you wont have to prepend `npx`)*</sup> by running,
```bash
npm install -g @henrycunh/ev
```

### Adding new variables
```bash
ev MY_KEY=VALUE OTHER_KEY=OTHER_VALUE
```
<sup>‚Ñπ This will add the `MY_KEY` and `OTHER_KEY` variables, if the variables already exists, their value will be overrided</sup>


### Exporting variables into the environment
```bash
ev | source
```
<sup>‚Ñπ This will export every variable into the environment</sup>

You can test it by running

```bash
ev TEST=123 && ev | source && echo $TEST
```
<sup>‚Ñπ This should print `Added 1 variables.` followed by `123`.</sup>

### Removing variables
```bash
ev rm MY_KEY OTHER_KEY
```
<sup>‚Ñπ This will remove the `MY_KEY` and `OTHER_KEY` variables</sup>

### Listing variables
```bash
ev ls
```
<sup>‚Ñπ This will list all variables</sup>
```bash
ev ls MY_KEY
```
<sup>‚Ñπ This will list the `MY_KEY` variable</sup>

### Changing the secret key
```bash
ev change-secret
```
<sup>‚Ñπ This will prompt for the old key and the new one, if the old key is correct, it will re-encrypt the variables with the new one</sup>


### Setting the secret key
In case you mistype your secret, you can just run this to type the secret again
```bash
ev set-secret
```
<sup>‚Ñπ This will prompt for the secret</sup>

### Using different environments
You can append the option `--env` <sup>*(or `-e`)*</sup> on any command to specify a different environment
```bash
ev -e staging MY_KEY=VALUE_IN_STAGING
```
<sup>‚Ñπ The variables for each environment is stored in a different file</sup>

### Loading variables from a `.env` file
```bash
ev load .env
```
<sup>‚Ñπ All the variables on `.env` will be loaded into the default environment</sup>

## Using in your project
After initializing and setting a secret, you can just load from your previous `.env` file with the command `ev load .env` and run either `ev | source` or `eval $(ev)` to export the variables into the environment.

### Passing a secret through a environment variable
In a CI environment, you want your secret to be passed through an environment variable set by your CI system. You can do this by setting the `EV_SECRET` variable
```bash
EV_SECRET=my-secret ev | source
```

### Javascript projects
You can add a `pre` script to your `package.json` file to load the variables into the environment before your development script runs. Here's an example:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "predev": "eval $(ev)",
    "dev": "..."
  }
}
```
You can even create different scripts for different environments
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "predev:staging": "eval $(ev -e staging)",
    "dev:staging": "..."
  }
}
```
